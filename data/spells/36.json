The spell fails if you canâ€™t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that canâ€™t accommodate the cloud).","When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.","If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d10."],"higher_level":["When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd."],"page":"phb 220","range":"120 feet","components":["V","S"],"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level":3,"school":{"name":"Conjuration","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/2"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/4","name":"Druid"}],"subclasses":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/2","name":"Lore"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/4","name":"Land"}],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/36"}
