A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.","This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You donâ€™t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense."],"page":"phb 241","range":"120 feet","components":["V","S"],"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level":2,"school":{"name":"Divination","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/3"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/3","name":"Cleric"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/4","name":"Druid"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/8","name":"Ranger"}],"subclasses":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/2","name":"Lore"}],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/113"}
