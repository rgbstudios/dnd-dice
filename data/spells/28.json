You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.","When a creature enters the wallâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage."],"page":"phb 218","range":"90 feet","components":["V","S"],"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level":6,"school":{"name":"Evocation","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/5"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/3","name":"Cleric"}],"subclasses":[],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/28"}
