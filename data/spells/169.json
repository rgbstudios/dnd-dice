The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.","When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spellâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.","The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns."],"page":"phb 253","range":"150 feet","components":["V","S"],"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level":8,"school":{"name":"Conjuration","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/2"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/10","name":"Sorcerer"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/12","name":"Wizard"}],"subclasses":[],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/169"}
