If the creatureâ€™s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.","This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesnâ€™t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these arenâ€™t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell canâ€™t return an undead creature to life.","This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesnâ€™t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survivalâ€”its head, for instanceâ€”the spell automatically fails.","Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears."],"page":"phb 270","range":"Touch","components":["V","S","M"],"material":"A diamond worth at least 500gp, which the spell consumes.","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 hour","level":5,"school":{"name":"Necromancy","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/7"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/2","name":"Bard"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/3","name":"Cleric"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/7","name":"Paladin"}],"subclasses":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/3","name":"Life"}],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/238"}
