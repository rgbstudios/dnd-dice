Each target must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.","An affected targetâ€™s speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and dexterity saving throws, and it canâ€™t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creatureâ€™s abilities or magic items, it canâ€™t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.","If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesnâ€™t take effect until the creatureâ€™s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it canâ€™t, the spell is wasted.","A creature affected by this spell makes another wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it."],"page":"phb 277","range":"120 feet","components":["V","S","M"],"material":"A drop of molasses.","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level":3,"school":{"name":"Transmutation","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/8"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/10","name":"Sorcerer"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/12","name":"Wizard"}],"subclasses":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/2","name":"Lore"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/4","name":"Land"}],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/270"}
