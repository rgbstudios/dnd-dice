While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and canâ€™t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.","If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it canâ€™t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance."],"page":"phb 288","range":"30 feet","components":["V","S","M"],"material":"Fire and holy water.","ritual":"no","duration":"8 hours","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 minute","level":6,"school":{"name":"Transmutation","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/8"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/4","name":"Druid"}],"subclasses":[],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/315"}
