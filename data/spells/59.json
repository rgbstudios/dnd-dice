{"_id":"5bce91f95b7768e79201850c","index":59,"name":"Contact Other Plane","desc":["You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you canâ€™t take actions, canâ€™t understand what other creatures say, canâ€™t read, and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast on you ends this effect.","On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as â€œyes,â€� â€œno,â€� â€œmaybe,â€� â€œnever,â€� â€œirrelevant,â€� or â€œunclearâ€� (if the entity doesnâ€™t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer."],"page":"phb 226","range":"Self","components":["V"],"ritual":"yes","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 minute","level":5,"school":{"name":"Divination","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/3"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/11","name":"Warlock"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/12","name":"Wizard"}],"subclasses":[],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/59"}
