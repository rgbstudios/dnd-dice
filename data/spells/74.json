The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.","If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isnâ€™t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.","If any of this spellâ€™s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled."],"page":"phb 230","range":"60 feet","components":["V","S"],"ritual":"no","duration":"1 hour","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level":3,"school":{"name":"Evocation","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/5"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/3","name":"Cleric"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/4","name":"Druid"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/7","name":"Paladin"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/8","name":"Ranger"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/10","name":"Sorcerer"}],"subclasses":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/2","name":"Lore"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/4","name":"Land"}],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/74"}
