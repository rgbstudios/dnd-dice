You decide the creatureâ€™s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.","For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage."],"page":"phb 265","range":"30 feet","components":["V","S"],"ritual":"yes","duration":"1 hour","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 minute","level":3,"school":{"name":"Illusion","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/6"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/12","name":"Wizard"}],"subclasses":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/2","name":"Lore"}],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/217"}
