On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage canâ€™t reduce the targetâ€™s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creatureâ€™s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes."],"page":"phb 249","range":"60 feet","components":["V","S"],"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level":6,"school":{"name":"Necromancy","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/7"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/3","name":"Cleric"}],"subclasses":[],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/151"}
