The DM chooses from the following possible omens:","- Weal, for good results","- Woe, for bad results","- Weal and woe, for both good and bad results","- Nothing, for results that arenâ€™t especially good or bad","The spell doesnâ€™t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.","If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading.
