When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:","- Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.","- While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.","- While cursed, the target must make a wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.","- While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.","A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the DMâ€™s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curseâ€™s effect."],"higher_level":["If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.
