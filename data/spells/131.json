Each creature within the area must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.","If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.","You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the slingâ€™s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasnâ€™t already shattered, it explodes."],"higher_level":["When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th."],"page":"phb 263","range":"300 feet","components":["V","S","M"],"material":"A small crystal sphere.","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level":6,"school":{"name":"Evocation","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/5"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/12","name":"Wizard"}],"subclasses":[],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/131"}
