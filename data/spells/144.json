The guardian occupies that space and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield emblazoned with the symbol of your deity.","Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage."],"page":"phb 246","range":"30 feet","components":["V"],"ritual":"no","duration":"8 hours","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level":4,"school":{"name":"Conjuration","url":""},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/3","name":"Cleric"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/7","name":"Paladin"}],"subclasses":[],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/144"}
