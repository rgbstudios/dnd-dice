The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision canâ€™t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light canâ€™t illuminate it.","If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isnâ€™t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.","If any of this spellâ€™s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled."],"page":"phb 230","range":"60 feet","components":["V","M"],"material":"Bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal.","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level":2,"school":{"name":"Evocation","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/5"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/10","name":"Sorcerer"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/11","name":"Warlock"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/12","name":"Wizard"}],"subclasses":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/2","name":"Lore"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/4","name":"Land"}],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/72"}
