The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isnâ€™t affected.","While in this form, the targetâ€™s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target canâ€™t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.","While in the form of a misty cloud, the target canâ€™t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding canâ€™t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target canâ€™t attack or cast spells."],"page":"phb 244","range":"Touch","components":["V","S","M"],"material":"A bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke.","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 hour","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level":3,"school":{"name":"Transmutation","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/8"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/10","name":"Sorcerer"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/11","name":"Warlock"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/12","name":"Wizard"}],"subclasses":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/2","name":"Lore"},{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/subclasses/4","name":"Land"}],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/132"}
