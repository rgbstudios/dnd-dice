For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.","When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.","A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself."],"page":"phb 238","range":"90 feet","components":["V","S","M"],"material":"A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level":4,"school":{"name":"Conjuration","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/2"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/12","name":"Wizard"}],"subclasses":[],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/27"}
