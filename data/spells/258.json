When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and canâ€™t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.","If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesnâ€™t grow older.","You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include â€œafter 1,000 yearsâ€� or â€œwhen the tarrasque awakens.â€� This spell also ends if the target takes any damage."],"page":"phb 274","range":"Touch","components":["V","S","M"],"material":"A powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes.","ritual":"no","duration":"Until dispelled","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level":7,"school":{"name":"Transmutation","url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/8"},"classes":[{"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/12","name":"Wizard"}],"subclasses":[],"url":"http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/258"}
